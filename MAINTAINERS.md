# Helm Maintainers

This document serves to describe the leadership structure of the Helm project, and list the current
project maintainers.

# What is a maintainer?

(Unabashedly stolen from the [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/MAINTAINERS) project)

Maintainers have 3 things in common:
1. They share responsibility in the project's success.
2. They have made a long-term, recurring time investment to improve the project.
3. They spend that time doing whatever needs to be done, not necessarily what
is the most interesting or fun.

Maintainers are often under-appreciated, because their work is harder to appreciate.
It's easy to appreciate a really cool and technically advanced feature. It's harder
to appreciate the absence of bugs, the slow but steady improvement in stability,
or the reliability of a release process. But those things distinguish a good
project from a great one.

# Helm maintainers

Helm has one group of maintainers in addition to our beloved Benevolent Dictator for Life. In
the future the Helm project will develop two levels of maintainers: Core Maintainers and
Contributing Maintainers.  For now, while the team is relatively small, only one type is needed.

## BDFL

Helm follows the timeless, highly efficient and totally unfair system known as [Benevolent dictator
for life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life).

Gabriel Monroy ([@gabrtv](https://github.com/gabrtv)), as creator of the Helm project, serves as our
project's BDFL. While the day-to-day project management is carried out by the maintainers, Gabriel
serves as the final arbiter of any disputes and has the final say on project direction.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are exceptionally knowledgeable about all areas of Helm. Some maintainers work on Helm
full-time, although this is not a requirement.

The duties of a maintainer include:
* Classify and respond to GitHub issues and review pull requests
* Help to shape the Helm roadmap and lead efforts to accomplish roadmap milestones
* Participate actively in feature development and bug fixing
* Answer questions and help users in IRC

The current maintainers of Helm:
* Matt Butcher - <mbutcher@engineyard.com> ([@technosophos](https://github.com/technosophos))
* Matt Boersma - <mboersma@engineyard.com> ([@mboersma](https://github.com/mboersma))
* Chris Armstrong - <carmstrong@engineyard.com> ([@carmstrong](https://github.com/carmstrong))

No pull requests can be merged until at least two maintainer signs off with an
[LGTM](http://docs.helm.io/en/latest/contributing/standards/#merge-approval).

## Becoming a maintainer

The Helm project wouldn't be where it is today without its community. Many of the project's
community members embody the spirit of maintainership, and have contributed substantially to
the project.

Generally, potential maintainers are selected by the Helm maintainers based in
part on the following criteria:
* Sustained and valued contributions to the project over a period of time (usually months)
* A willingness to help Helm users on GitHub and in IRC
* A friendly attitude :)

The Helm maintainers must unanimously agree before inviting a community member to join as a
maintainer, although in many cases the candidate has already been acting in the
capacity of a maintainer for some time, and has been consulted on issues, pull requests,
etc.
